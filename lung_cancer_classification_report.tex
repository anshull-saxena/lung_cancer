\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive deep learning framework for automated lung histopathology classification, addressing the critical need for accurate computer-aided diagnosis in lung cancer detection. Our system integrates multiple convolutional neural network architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) with advanced attention mechanisms including Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks and multi-head channel attention. The framework incorporates a two-stage feature optimization pipeline: True mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) ranking followed by Enhanced Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimizer (AGWO) for intelligent feature subset selection. Classification is performed using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) with majority voting fusion. Experimental validation on a dataset of 15,000 lung histopathology images demonstrates competitive performance with 98.70\% ensemble accuracy and 49.6\% feature reduction. While achieving slightly lower accuracy than the baseline study (99.75\%), our multi-architecture approach provides enhanced robustness, scalability, and generalization potential through architectural diversity. The system represents a significant advancement in automated histopathology analysis, offering a scalable framework for clinical deployment with improved computational efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Histopathology analysis plays a vital role in cancer diagnosis, requiring expert pathologists to examine tissue samples under microscopes. However, this process is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. The development of automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using deep learning techniques has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

The primary challenge in lung cancer histopathology classification lies in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High inter-class similarity between different cancer subtypes
    \item Large intra-class variations in tissue appearance
    \item Requirement for high accuracy in medical diagnosis
    \item Need for robust feature representation and classification
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

The main objectives of this study are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop an automated system for classifying lung histopathology images into ACA, Normal, and SCC categories
    \item To implement and evaluate multiple CNN architectures with attention mechanisms
    \item To optimize feature selection using evolutionary algorithms
    \item To create an ensemble classification system for improved accuracy
    \item To achieve clinically acceptable classification performance
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature Review}

Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized medical image analysis. Several studies have explored CNN-based approaches for histopathology classification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DenseNet}: Huang et al. introduced densely connected networks that maximize information flow between layers \cite{huang2017densenet}.
    \item \textbf{ResNet}: He et al. developed residual networks that address the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks \cite{he2016resnet}.
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanisms}: Hu et al. proposed Squeeze-and-Excitation networks that adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses \cite{hu2018senet}.
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Methods}: Surveys and empirical studies indicate that combining multiple classifiers can improve overall performance and robustness in medical imaging \cite{litjens2017survey}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Description}

The dataset consists of 15,000 lung histopathology images divided into three classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lung Adenocarcinoma (ACA)}: 5,000 images
    \item \textbf{Normal Lung Tissue (N)}: 5,000 images  
    \item \textbf{Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)}: 5,000 images
\end{itemize}

All images are in JPEG format and were preprocessed to a standardized size of 224×224 pixels for consistent input to the CNN models.

\subsection{System Architecture}

The proposed system follows a multi-stage pipeline:

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction Stage}

Our system employs multiple CNN architectures for comprehensive feature extraction:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DenseNet121}: Dense connectivity where each layer receives inputs from all preceding layers \cite{huang2017densenet}.
    \item \textbf{ResNet50}: Residual connections enabling training of very deep networks \cite{he2016resnet}.
    \item \textbf{VGG16}: Classic convolutional architecture with 16 layers \cite{simonyan2014vgg}.
    \item \textbf{EfficientNetB0} (multi-head variant): Compound scaling for efficient accuracy/compute trade-offs.
    \item \textbf{InceptionV3} (multi-head variant): Multi-scale feature extraction with inception modules.
\end{enumerate}

Each CNN backbone is enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks and multi-head channel attention mechanisms. The multi-head attention system processes features through 8 parallel attention heads, enabling comprehensive analysis of channel-wise dependencies and improved feature representation.

\subsubsection{Multi-Head Channel Attention}

The multi-head attention mechanism represents a significant advancement over traditional single-head attention:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parallel Processing}: 8 attention heads process features simultaneously
    \item \textbf{Global Pooling}: Both average and maximum pooling for comprehensive feature extraction
    \item \textbf{Channel Recalibration}: Adaptive weighting based on attention scores
    \item \textbf{GPU Optimization}: Parallel processing for computational efficiency
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Selection Stage}

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed for automated feature selection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population Size}: 40 individuals
    \item \textbf{Generations}: 10 iterations
    \item \textbf{Fitness Function}: Cross-validated KNN accuracy with L0 penalty for sparsity
    \item \textbf{Genetic Operations}: Two-point crossover and bit-flip mutation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Classification Stage}

An ensemble of three traditional machine learning algorithms is used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}: k=5 with distance weighting
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}: RBF kernel with probability estimates
    \item \textbf{Random Forest (RF)}: 300 trees with parallel processing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fusion Stage}

Final predictions are obtained through majority voting, where the class receiving the most votes from the three classifiers is selected as the final prediction.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Train-Test Split}: 80\% training (12,000 images), 20\% testing (3,000 images)
    \item \textbf{Batch Size}: 24 images per batch
    \item \textbf{Image Preprocessing}: Resize to 224×224, normalization
    \item \textbf{Random Seed}: Fixed at 42 for reproducibility
    \item \textbf{Hardware}: GPU-accelerated training with CUDA support
\end{itemize}

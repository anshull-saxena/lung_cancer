# Lung Cancer Project

This repository contains code and resources for lung cancer analysis and prediction. The project leverages machine learning and data science techniques to analyze lung cancer datasets, build predictive models, and visualize results.

## Project Structure
- `code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, model training, and results.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshull-saxena/lung_cancer.git
   cd lung_cancer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook code.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Open `code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow the steps in the notebook to run data analysis and model training.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for the list of required Python packages.
